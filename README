This plugin facilitates renaming (i.e. moving) pages, saving as (i.e. saving a page
under a new name without deleting the original) and creating new pages from templates.

There are three syntax formats:

        ~~SaveAS>newname~~        
        ~~MoveTO>newname~~'
        ~~OpenAS>newname#template>newpagevars~~

newname can be a namespace:pagename

The SaveAS form will create a new page from the old page but leave the old page in tact.

The MoveTO form will creat a new page from the old page and delete the old page.  However,
it will not delete the old page unless it is certain that the new page is in place, so that
there is no danger of losing the old page. MoveTO does not currently accommodate backlinks,
so that pages which link to the deleted page will have to be updated manually.  Some
form of accommodation may eventually be implemented. 

The OpenAS form requires the newpagetemplate plugin.  The will open the page 'newname',
using the specified template.   The current implementation of the OpenAS plugin
assumes that all your templates will be found in the pagetemplates directory
(i.e the :pagetemplates namespace).  The newpagevars element follows the format described
on the newpagetemplate plugin page on Dokuiwiki.  Here is a sample:

   ~~OpenAS>hello_temp#homepagetemplate>@HI@,HOWDY!;@BYE@,Good Bye~~

This will open up the page :hello_temp, using the homepagetemplate (which is
:pagetemplates:homepagetemplate) and it will fill in any of the substitution variables
defined on the newpagetemplate plugin page, as well as the variables defined
by newpagevar(which in this example are: @HI@ and @BYE@).
